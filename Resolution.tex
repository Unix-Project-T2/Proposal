The two CAs that will be used to test each system will be SVM and kNN. 
The dataset has yet to be determined but we are looking for one with a 
few million tuples. The CAs  will be implemented 
in Python using Scikit-learn, a free software ML library for the Python 
programming language (PL). The platforms on which we will test our 
algorithms will be provided by one of our team members who owns the 
laptop with dedidicated GPU and the single, triple, and sextuple GPU 
desktops. The CACDS intitute will provide access to the Sabine Cluster 
as mentioned above. Bash scripting will also be used to consolidate the 
testing procedures and be the intermediary between the user and the Operating System (OS).
