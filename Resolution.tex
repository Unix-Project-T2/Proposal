The two classification algorithms that we propose to test will be 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). The 
dataset has yet to be determined but we are looking for one with a 
few million tuples. The classification algorithms will be implemented 
in Python using Scikit-learn, a free software ML library for the Python 
programming language (PL). The platforms on which we will test our 
algorithms on will be provided by one of our team members who owns the 
laptop with dedidicated GPU and the single, triple, and sextuple GPU 
desktops. The CACDS intitute will provide access to the Sabine Cluster 
as mentioned above.
