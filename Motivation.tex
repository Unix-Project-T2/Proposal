Machine Learning (ML) has become a hot topic in the recent years. 
Various industries have begun to dive into ML concepts and algorithms  
to improve decision making, predict market sentiment, and understand consumers. 
College undergraduates and interested programmers have noticed this trend and have begun diving 
into ML techniques and concepts. Through decades of testing, it has been shown the 
Central Processing Units (CPUs) alone are not suffice to run ML algorithms efficiently, 
even if the Random Access Memory (RAM) cards are upgraded. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) 
were thus found to be a parameter whithin a system that yield better results. 
In recent years, GPUs have be proven to be useful tools when attempting to implement ML in a project. 
A large number of GPUs within a system, known as a GPU cluster, have been contributing to the efficiency 
of super computers for decades.
