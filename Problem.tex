For this project, we propose to run an two identical ML classification algorithms on a 
variety of platforms to measure efficiency and results. The goal is to compare each platform 
and analyze which gave an acceptable result given the cost of the machine. Intuitivelty, the 
platform with the most amount of GPUs will preform the best but at its price, will not suit 
well for novice students on a budget. With this in mind we propose running the classification 
algorithms on several platforms: a laptop with a dedicated GPU, a desktop with one GPU, another 
desktop with three GPUs, another with 6 GPUs, finally with the help of the Center for Advanced 
Computing and Data Science (CACDS) we will run these classification algorithms on the Sabine
Cluster that host a total of 5704 CPU cores and 12 GPU nodes.
