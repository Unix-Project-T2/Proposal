For this project, we propose to run two ML classification algorithms (CAs) on a single dataset: 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). 
The goal is to determine which system can perform ML classification the best at a reasonable price 
so that novice programmers can use as reference. Intuitivelty, the 
platform with the most amount of GPUs will preform the best but at its price, will not suit 
well for novice students on a budget. With this in mind we propose running the CAs on several platforms: 
a laptop with a dedicated GPU, a desktop with one GPU, another 
desktop with three GPUs, another with six GPUs, finally with the help of the Center for Advanced 
Computing and Data Science (CACDS) we will run these CAs on the Sabine
Cluster that host a total of 5704 CPU cores and 12 GPU nodes.
